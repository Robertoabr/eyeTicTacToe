# eyeTicTacToe

An OpenCV.js experiment in front-end image processing. The library was quite new and I wanted to test it out. I created a computer vision focused webpage designed to recognize the board state of tic tac toe game.

Currently the page is able to take in photos of a tic tac toe game state, and recognize the board quadrants and the location of the Os on the board. This is as far as I want to take this experiment. 

In the near future I will stick with using Open CV for Python as the community is much larger, and currently javascript does not have good numpy equivalent which can be used for easy matrix manipulation.
