# eyeTicTacToe

An OpenCV.js experiment in front-end image processing. A computer vision focused web app designed to recognize the board state of tic tac toe game.

Currently is able to take in photos of a tic tac toe game state and recognize the board quadrants and the location of the Os on the board. This is as far as I want to take this experiment. In the near future I will stick with using Open CV for Python as the community is much larger, and currently javascript does not have essential matrix manipulation libraries like numpy.
